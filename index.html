          From a modest start in 1964, the Cebu College of Commerce (CCC) of old
          has come a long way. Beginning with a handful of enrollees, what used to
          be an undersized college has succesfully evolved into a world-class
          university in Asia Pacific, while holding true to its philantropic
          mantra, "NO TUITION FEE INCREASE".

          With forty-two (42) years of quality
          education, the University of Cebu (UC) has been awarded a Deregulated
          status by the Commision on Higher Education (CHED), while recognized by
          the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commision on
          Accreditation (PACUCOA) as a learning institution with the most
          accredited programs.
