        From a modest start in 1964, the Cebu College of Commerce (CCC) of old
        has come a long way. Beginning with a handful of enrollees, what used to
        be an undersized college has succesfully evolved into a world-class
        university in Asia Pacific, while holding true to its philantropic
        mantra, "NO TUITION FEE INCREASE". With forty-two (42) years of quality
        education, the University of Cebu (UC) has been awarded a Deregulated
        status by the Commision on Higher Education (CHED), while recognized by
        the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commision on
        Accreditation (PACUCOA) as a learning institution with the most
        accredited programs.
